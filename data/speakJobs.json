We’re a team of more than 90 based throughout San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and Ljubljana.<br><br><br>We are seeking actors to appear in our app-based video lessons as language teachers (watch the sample video below under each role for reference). In these video lessons, you’ll be seated behind a table facing a camera and deliver pre-written scripts explaining language concepts and phrases for learners.

Those who learned Mandarin in high school or college will not qualify.<br>We want the Mandarin to be delivered in a neutral Mandarin accent that appeals to global Mandarin speakers.<br>For native Mandarin speakers, having an accent in English to a certain degree is ok, as long as your delivery of English lines is very clear, fluent, and easily comprehensible by English speakers.<br>Example Video:<br>https://youtu.be/_l9U-4Qly6k?si=wdMPBqj4GVQB3TKx<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5A8Q16jeoU<br>How to audition: see Full Instructions\n\n請務必上傳您自錄的試鏡帶。若無上傳，您提交的資料與申請將不被考慮。<br>\n请务必上传您自录的试镜带。若无上传，您提交的资料与申请将不被考虑。\n<br>Hourly $50.00 – $75.00 per hour<br>At Speak, our compensation philosophy is based on work experience, interview performance, leveling and other factors evaluated during the hiring process.<br><br>Join a fantastic, tight-knit team at the right time: we're growing very quickly, we've most recently raised our Series C from some of the top investors in the valley, and we've achieved product-market fit in our initial markets.
