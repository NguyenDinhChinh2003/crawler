    "description": "Title: Senior Backend Engineer – MetaMask\n\nLocation: UNITED STATES – Remote\n\nJob Description:\n\nUS or Remote (non-EU*, non-Australia, non-Canada)\n\nConsensys is the leading blockchain and web3 software company founded by Joe Lubin, CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum. Since 2014, Consensys has been at the forefront of innovation, pioneering technological developments within the web3 ecosystem.\n\nThrough our product suite, including the MetaMask platform, Infura, Linea, Diligence, and our NFT toolkit Phosphor, we have become the trusted collaborator for users, creators, and developers on their path to build and belong in the world they want to see.\n\nWhether building a dapp, an NFT collection, a portfolio, or a better future, the instinct to build is universal. Consensys inspires and champions the builder instinct in everyone by making web3 universally easy to use and develop on.\n\nOur mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making the decentralized web universally easy to access, use, and build on.\n\nYou’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to onboard one billion participants and 5 million developers. You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects – challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of builders that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\n\nAbout MetaMask\n\nWe’re building for a future where the internet and world economy empowers people through interactions based on consent, privacy, and free association, where both communities and individuals flourish. To accomplish that, we’re working hard to make web3 accessible for everyone.\n\nMetaMask is both a crypto wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web. Our tools help people create communities, play video games, access financial services, make payments, invest in assets, protect against economic turmoil, and more. Our browser extension and mobile platforms meet the needs of millions of users and developers across the world.\n\nThe MetaMask Wallet API Platform Team\n\nEmpowering developers to deliver great decentralized user experiences is at the heart of MetaMask’s purpose. From the beginning, we have done so by providing the web with an API that allows any developer to turn their site or web-app into a decentralized app connected to the blockchain.\n\nCurrently the MetaMask Wallet API allows dApps to do things like: propose transactions to users, access the address of the users current account, use keys in MetaMask to help users encrypt and decrypt messages, propose to users that they sign specific messages, access the connected node/provider and call all methods on the Ethereum RPC API, and to propose that users add and switch to a specific network. We enhance and expand this list of capabilities and build tools to help other teams build new capabilities themselves.\n\nBy improving and expanding this API, we can make entirely new types of decentralized user experiences possible. There is also much work to do to make this API accessible for the many new developers joining our space.\n\nWe are hiring engineers to join our Wallet API Platform team and help us build the platform on which the world’s most exciting dapps will be built.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nBuild and maintain Wallet API infrastructure and tooling.\nHelp to manage and govern a pipeline of proposed new APIs.\nWork with partners and standards bodies across the Web3 ecosystem to shape wallet API standards.\n\nWould be great if you brought this to the role\n\nWe are looking for a senior software engineer who is:\n\nGrowth-minded and collaborative, and who thrives in an environment with some ambiguity, autonomy, and the freedom to experiment.\nProficient and thoughtful with asynchronous and synchronous communication and with giving and receiving feedback\nSupportive of their team’s collective performance and growth\nSuccessfully working in a fully remote environment, individually and within a team\nRespectful, patient, and empathic in every interaction and relationship with their coworkers and the community\nAble to work towards technical clarity amidst competing viewpoints\nEnthusiastic and unwavering on shipping high-quality code\nInterested in working with partners across the Web3 ecosystem on shared Wallet API standards\n\nThe Wallet API Platform team carries an important mission to craft and maintain the best API for developers so that MetaMask can continue to grow with the wider Web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe senior software engineer role is a critical part of this team. They would be responsible for creating and managing the API that all MetaMask developers are using. As web3 evolves, the API needs to evolve with the larger ecosystem. This requires a team of highly dynamic and agile software engineers to serve MetaMask’s developer community.\n\nBecause of the complexity and nascency of web3, most of our API have a very long lifecycle after being made publicly available. The engineer who takes on this role will be the guardian of a high-quality API with a long lifecycle in a rapidly evolving ecosystem. This engineer must have a long-term mindset when planning and designing the API as well as introducing any new major change.\n\nTechnical requirements:\n\n4 years of JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js experience\n2 years of experience working on a team of at least 3 other engineers with a strong focus on peer reviews\n1 year of working experience with building/deploying dapps and/or web3/ethers.js libraries\n2 years of experience with architecting, implementing, and/or managing externally-facing APIs (used by developers not belonging to the same organization)\n2 years of experience managing an existing codebase\n1 year of experience owning and managing unit, integration, end-to-end tests, and/or testing frameworks/strategies\n1 year of experience with JSON-RPC, Swagger, and/or OpenAPI\n\nBonus points:\n\nMobile development experience\nSecurity engineering\nInvolvement in EIP authoring or review processes\nBrowser APIs\n\nDon’t meet all the requirements? Don’t sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you’ve got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment-apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we’re ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nThe salary range for US-based candidates only will be determined throughout the interview process depending on experience and skills.\n\nUS pay range (not including bonus, equity or other benefits)\n\n$100,000—$237,000 USD\n\nIn the rapidly evolving Web3 space, we believe that everyone is a builder. This expansive paradigm requires a range of backgrounds, talents, skills, and experiences to influence and shape the future. At Consensys, this diversity fuels our ability to shift control and redefine the realm of possibility. We are committed to ensuring that our technology empowers people and communities with economic and political agency through decentralized technologies. We welcome the range of perspectives and differences and celebrate them. We’re excited to see how your unique skills as a builder can contribute to our vision, drive innovation, and help us shape a more inclusive Web3.\n\nConsensys is an equal opportunity employer.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout the organization\n\nStripe’s Payments and Risk organizations are at the heart of Stripe’s business. They are responsible for enabling our users to accept payments worldwide, in a secure and reliable fashion.\n\nYou may work on a wide variety of critical business areas including:\n\nPayins: The Payins organization oversees the fundamental primitives of collecting payments across the Stripe ecosystem. Custodians of mission-critical foundations, and stewards of essential administrative payment workflows, merchants rely on us to innovate on the fundamentals. We act as catalysts towards realizing Stripe’s flexible and extensible multi-product platform.\nOptimized Checkout & Link: The Optimized Checkout and Link teams focus on building best-in-class checkout experiences that provide delightful checkout experiences for customers, while driving higher purchase conversion for merchants. As an organization, we work on Checkout, Payment Links, Elements, Payment Methods, and Link – each playing a crucial part in augmenting the economic landscape of the internet.\n\nWithin this organization, we are looking for frontend engineers across a few different areas:\n\nProduct: You’ll join a payments team building high-quality UIs for merchants’ checkout pages or the Stripe Dashboard working with experienced frontend and full-stack engineers to deliver world-class checkout experiences. You’ll work with engineers, product managers, designers, and stakeholders across the organization to build new features and products across Elements, Checkout, and Link.\nFrontend Platform: As a platform engineer you will be building tools and systems to enable a 100+ engineering organization to deliver delightful frontend features for millions of Stripe merchants. Our team places a heavy emphasis on being domain experts on how to develop reliably and safely for the web platform at a very high scale.\nExperimentation/Growth: As part of a growth-focused engineering team, you will improve our buyer-facing experiences, experimentation foundations, and systems that power intelligence to improve a consumer’s experience and checkout conversion. This is a new, exciting area of focus for our organization, and we are looking for frontend engineers with growth or experimentation expertise to help us deliver more experiments than we’ve ever run before, and help us improve our foundations. You’ll work closely with data science, product managers, and designers to create, build, and execute buyer experiments efficiently.\n\nAs a frontend engineer at Stripe, you’ll join fast-moving teams building consumer-focused UIs and full-stack products.

Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation.\nUphold our high engineering standards and bring consistency to the many codebases and processes you will encounter.\n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum requirements\n\n2+ years of software development experience, with an emphasis on modern frontend technologies (HTML/CSS/TypeScript/React) and building delightful user interfaces.\nComfort operating as a frontend developer and owning projects end-to-end.\nAre motivated by solving hard problems, and measure your success in terms of impact doing so.\nThrive in a highly collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.\nEnjoy working with a diverse group of people with different areas of expertise.\n\nPreferred qualifications\n\nExperience working in high-growth teams similar to Stripe.\nExperience building financial systems or tools for financial experts.\n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual US base salary range for this role is $150,500 – $269,200. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nAdditional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",
